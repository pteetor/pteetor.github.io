  <title>Finding Seasonal Spreads</title>
</head>
<body>
A <span style="font-style: italic;">seasonal spread</span> is a spread
which follows a regular pattern from year to year, such as generally
falling in the Spring or generally rising in October. &nbsp;To find
seasonal spreads, I've been using <span style="font-style: italic;">ANOVA</span>,
which stands for&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">analysis
of variance</span>. &nbsp;ANOVA is a well-established statistical
technique
which, given several groups of data, will determine if the groups have
different averages. &nbsp;Importantly, it determines if the
differences are <span style="font-style: italic;">statistically
significantly</span>.<br>
<br>
I start with several years of spread data, compute the spread's daily
changes, then group the daily changes by their calendar month, giving
me
12 groups. &nbsp;The ANOVA analysis tells me if the groups (months)
have significantly different averages. &nbsp;If so, I know the spread
is seasonal since it is consistently up in certain months and
consistently down in others.<br>
<br>
The beauty is that I can automate the process, scanning my entire
database for seasonal spreads. &nbsp;A recent scan identified the
spread between crude oil (CL) and gasoline (RB), for example. &nbsp;The
initial ANOVA analysis indicated the CL/RB spread is very likely to be
seasonal. &nbsp;This bar chart of each month's average daily change
demonstrates the seasonality. &nbsp;(Click on the graph to enlarge it.)<br>

The lines show the confidence
interval for each month's average.&nbsp;
Notice how May and June are definitely "up" months because their
confidence interval is entirely positive (above the axis).
&nbsp;Likewise, November and December are definitely "down" months.
&nbsp;For all other months, we cannot be certain because the confidence
interval crosses zero, so the true average change could be either
negative or positive. &nbsp;The conclusion: &nbsp;Be long the spread
during May and June; be short during November and December.<br>
