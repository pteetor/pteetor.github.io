<h1 style="text-align: center;">Finding
Seasonal Spreads</h1>

Many spreads show seasonality -- that is, regular patterns from
year-to-year -- and can be a valuable source of profits and
diversification. &nbsp;Seasonal spreads, however,
seem
to get little attention from the quantitative community.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like to remedy that by showing one way to identify
seasonal
spreads using legitimate statistical techniques.&nbsp; I'll start
with
an example of a seasonal spread: crude oil <span
 style="font-style: italic;">versus</span>
gasoline.
<h2>Example: Crude oil versus
gasoline</h2>
Here is a chart of the spread between crude oil futures (CL) and
gasoline futures (RB) from 1997 to the present, covering about 12 years
of history.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img
 style="width: 576px; height: 504px;" alt="Chart of CL/RB spread"
 src="/images/cl.rb.spread.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
If you look closely, it appears that the spread often falls during
Winter, then rises from Spring into Summer.&nbsp; But how can we be
sure?&nbsp; Perhaps we are just imagining the pattern, based on a
few
examples.&nbsp; And what are the actual months when it falls and
rises?<br>
<br>
Here is how we can test for a seasonal pattern.
<ol>
  <li>Compute the daily change in
the spread, <span style="font-style: italic;">s</span><sub>t</sub>,
giving us one &Delta;<span style="font-style: italic;">s</span><sub>t</sub>
value for every day of the spread&rsquo;s history.</li>
  <li>For each day, group the
day&rsquo;s change according to the month
of that day.</li>
  <li>Compute the average change
for each monthly group.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
That will give a table such as this, with one mean change (&micro;)
for
every month, taken over all the years of spread history.<br>
<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<br>
(These averages are in dollars per day.) <br>
<br>
The monthly averages suggest trades:&nbsp; January is a down month,
on
average,
so sell the spread during January.&nbsp; Likewise, February is an
up
month, on average, so buy the spread during February.<br>
<br>
Those trades would be very na&iuml;ve, however.&nbsp; A
statistician
would ask an important question before risking real money:&nbsp;
What
is probability that the true mean is actually positive or
negative?&nbsp; The averages for April and August are pretty small
(12.98 and -12.9), for example.&nbsp; Maybe our sample is too
small,
and these averages are not representative.&nbsp; How realistic are
these numbers?<br>
<br>
The solution is to form confidence intervals for each monthly
mean.&nbsp; This barchart shows the mean change taken from the
table
above, then superimposes the confidence intervals over each bar, giving
us a composite view of the monthly averages.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img
 style="width: 576px; height: 432px;"
 alt="Barchart of mean daily spread change by month"
 src="/images/cl.rb.barchart.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
Consider the bar for January.&nbsp; Yes, the mean change is
negative,
but the confidence interval crosses over into positive
territory.&nbsp;
Statistically speaking, <span style="font-style: italic;">we cannot be
confident that the true mean is
negative</span>.&nbsp; It could
be zero or even positive, so selling
the
spread during January could be unwise.&nbsp; In fact, the
confidence
interval includes zero for most months, and we cannot be confident
there is any seasonal trend in those months, either positive or
negative.<br>
<br>
The confidence interval for May, however, is completely
positive.&nbsp;
We can be confident that the average historical daily change in May is
positive.&nbsp; In fact, May and June are clearly
&ldquo;up&rdquo;
months, and November and December are clearly
&ldquo;down&rdquo;
months.&nbsp; Now we have our seasonal trade for the CL/RB spread:
<ul>
  <li>Buy the spread on May
1.&nbsp; Close the position on Jul 1. </li>
  <li>Short the spread on Nov
1.&nbsp; Close the position on Jan 1. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding Seasonal Spreads
Automatically: ANOVA</h2>
This analysis would be quite tedious if we performed it manually for
every spread we know.&nbsp; Fortunately, we can use ANOVA to
automatically identify seasonality in spreads.<br>
<br>
ANOVA stands for <span style="font-style: italic;">analysis of variance</span>.&nbsp;
ANOVA compares groups of
observations, such as our month-wise groups of spread
changes.&nbsp; It
reports the probability that one or more groups have significantly
different means, compared with the other groups.<br>
<br>
The ANOVA report includes a <span style="font-style: italic;">probability
value</span>, or simply <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value,
which
is the probability that all the means are identical.&nbsp; So a
small
<span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value
means one or more
groups are probably not the same.&nbsp; In
the CL/RB example, above, my computer reports a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value
of less than
0.0001, so the probability that all months have the same average change
is less than 0.01%.<br>
<br>
My computer runs a weekly batch job which computes the ANOVA p-value
for every spread in my database.&nbsp; If the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value
is 0.05 or less,
I know there is a 95% probability that the spread changes are
significantly different from month-to-month; in other words, the spread
exhibits a seasonal pattern.&nbsp; In those cases, the batch job
saves
the <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value
in the
database.&nbsp; Later, I run a report to select the
spreads with the best (i.e., smallest) <span
 style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-values.&nbsp;
Those are my
candidates for seasonal trades.<br>
<br>
The computer tests every combination of stocks and futures, so it
occasionally reports a bizarre seasonal spread.&nbsp; It recently
discovered that the spread between British Pound futures (BP) and Live
Cattle (LC) shows seasonality at a confidence level of 96% or
better.&nbsp; Would I trade the BP/LC spread?&nbsp; Of course
not,
because I cannot discern the economic logic of the trade.
<h2>Limitations</h2>
This analysis is not an automated trading system and has important
limitations.
<ul>
  <li>The analysis does not make a
prediction.&nbsp; It only reports
the past pattern.&nbsp; When you trade that pattern, you are
assuming
this year is like other years. </li>
  <li>The basic ANOVA analysis
only reports that some months are
different, not which months are different.&nbsp; The trader must
look
at monthly pattern to choose the right time for the trade. </li>
  <li>The trade decision must also
incorporate the current market
conditions.&nbsp; For example, if the history recommends buying but
the
spread is already quite high, the trade could be unwise. </li>
  <li>This analysis looks at
monthly patterns.&nbsp; The seasonal
patterns at other boundaries might be more distinct and, hence, better
trades. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
We can augment this analysis by computing the spread&rsquo;s Z
score,
then selecting trades which show harmony between their historical
pattern and current status.&nbsp; We can also improve the analysis
by
incorporating a seasonal version of the <a
 href="http://epchan.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-is-your-stop-loss-strategy.html">Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
formula</a>,
letting us predict the time-to-profit.&nbsp; I hope to cover these
subjects in the future.
<h2>Additional Details For the
Curious</h2>
The data for the CL/RB spread, above, was purchased from <a
 href="http://www.csidata.com/">Commodity
Systems Inc.</a> (CSI), using their
Perpetual Contact data.&nbsp; This
example was as of Feb 5, 2009.
<p>When I say &ldquo;long the
CL/RB spread&rdquo;, I mean buy CL and
sell RB.&nbsp; Likewise, &ldquo;short the spread&rdquo;
means sell CL
and buy RB. </p>
<p>I compute the hedge ratios for
my spreads using ordinary least
squares, as suggested in <a
 href="http://epchan.blogspot.com/2008/11/my-book-on-quantitative-trading-is.html">Ernie
Chan's book</a>.&nbsp; The ratio for
the
CL/RB spread, above, was 1.1376 CL contracts for each RB contract. </p>
<p>Notice that I compute the
spread <span style="font-style: italic;">change</span>,
not the spread
<span style="font-style: italic;">return</span>.&nbsp;
Quants usually
study price returns, but that won&rsquo;t
work with spreads because the spread can be zero, giving an undefined
return.&nbsp; The daily change follows a similar bell-shaped
distribution, so it&rsquo;s a reasonable object for study. </p>
<p>I monitor about 115 stocks and
futures, so I have about 6,670
spreads to be tested weekly.&nbsp; A typical recent run found that
over
270 spreads that exhibit some seasonality, or about 4% of those
tested.&nbsp; The ANOVA batch job requires about 2-1/2 hours to
complete on my computer.&nbsp; The software is written in a
combination
of <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>
and <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>,
the free statistical software
system, running under
Linux. </p>
