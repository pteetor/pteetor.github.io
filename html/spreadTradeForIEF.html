<h1>A Spread Trade for IEF</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">iShares
Barclays 7-10
Year Treasury Bond Fund</span> (NYSE: IEF), is an exchange-traded fund
which holds primarily intermediate-term US
Treasury Notes. &nbsp;As the name suggests, the maturities of the
holdings range from 7 to 10 years.<br>
<br>
I wanted to determine if IEF could be hedged or replicated using a
combination of Treasury futures. &nbsp;If so, it might be possible
to trade the spread between IEF and futures. &nbsp;I initially
modeled
the hedge/spread using Eurodollar, 2-year, 5-year, and
10-years futures.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The final model, however, required
only
the 10-year futures. &nbsp;Furthermore, the model residuals are
demonstrably
mean-reverting, which naturally leads to relative value trades.</span>
&nbsp;This is very encouraging because it
suggests a simple spread -- IEF <span style="font-style: italic;">versus</span>
10-year Treasury Note futures -- could be profitably traded.<br>
<h2>Model Development</h2>
<h3>Full Model</h3>
The initial, full model was a time-series regression on the futures
prices using daily closing prices.<br>

<br>
&epsilon;<sub>i</sub>
~ ARIMA(<span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>,
1, <span style="font-style: italic;">q</span>)<br>
</div>
<br>
where<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ED</span>
is Eurodollar futures</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TU</span>
is the 2-year Treasury note futures</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">FV</span>
is the 5-year Treasury note futures, and</li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">TY</span>
is the 10-year Treasury note futures.</li>
</ul>
The initial fit selected <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>
= 3 and <span style="font-style: italic;">q</span>
= 4, giving an ARIMA(3,1,4) model for the residuals.<br>
<br>
I assumed that the <span style="font-style: italic;">FV </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">TY</span>
futures would be necessary for modeling <span
 style="font-style: italic;">IEF</span>
since the futures would, essentially, create a bar-bell portfolio which
matched the average maturity of the bond fund. &nbsp;I included <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ED</span>
in case the ETF, which pays monthly dividends, was sensitive to
short-term rate movements. &nbsp;I included&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">TU</span> simply for completeness, without
expectation it would be a significant predictor.
<h3>Reduced Model</h3>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">TU</span>
proved to be insignificant, which was not surprising. &nbsp;The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ED</span>
term was also insignificant, which was reasonable but a little
surprising.<br>
<br>
I was quite surprised, however, that the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">FV</span>
term was also insignificant. &nbsp;Evidently, the 10-year futures, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">TY</span>,
is sufficient to mimic the fund behaviour without the 5-year bar-bell
component. &nbsp;The final, reduced model was
very simple:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">IEF</span><sub>i</sub>
= &beta;<sub>0</sub>
+ &beta;<sub>TY</sub>&times;<span style="font-style: italic;">TY</span><sub>i</sub>
+ &epsilon;<sub>i</sub><br>
<br>
&epsilon;<sub>i</sub>
~ ARIMA(<span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>,
1, <span style="font-style: italic;">q</span>)<br>
</div>
<br>
A re-fit of the ARIMA model gave <span style="font-style: italic;">p</span>
= 1 and <span style="font-style: italic;">q</span>
= 2, for a final ARIMA(1,1,2) model of &epsilon;. &nbsp;The
indicated
hedge ratio was approximately 1,308 shares of IEF for each TY contract.
<h3>Model Assessment</h3>
The model residuals are mostly&nbsp;clean and show no bias.<br>
<br>

</div>
<br>
An obvious problem is the explosion in variance in the recent residuals
(extreme right-hand side). &nbsp;I assume this is caused by the
unprecedented&nbsp;conditions during the financial markets'
melt-down
of 2008. &nbsp;From a modeling standpoint, it suggests that the
market
has entered a new regime, and the model may require a local re-fit.<br>
<br>
The variance explosion is echoed in the Normal quantile-quantile plot
of the residuals.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img
 style="width: 400px; height: 400px;"
 alt="Normal Q-Q plot for IEF model residuals"
 src="http://quanttrader.info/public/images/ief.model.resid.qq.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
Clearly, there are out-sized residuals, as indicated by the fat tails.
&nbsp;This casts some suspicion on the model, but might be
explained by
the excessive market volatility of 2008.<br>
<br>
Testing the residuals for mean reversion gives a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">p</span>-value
of essentially zero, using
the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, so we can be confident they are
mean-reverting. &nbsp;This&nbsp;is no surprise after seeing the
plot of
residuals, above.
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
The main result here is that the 10-year Treasury Note futures (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">TY</span>)
seem sufficient for hedging the
IEF stock. &nbsp;This is a welcome result because the spread trade
is
quite simple and does not require a basket of futures contracts.<br>
<br>
A second result is that the model's residuals are historically
mean reverting, creating the opportunity for mean-reversion trades:
&nbsp;the residuals act as indicators of over- and under-valuation,
letting us enter the spread at opportune times. &nbsp;This chart of
recent residuals
illustrates some typical opportunities.<br>

<br>
Notice that the mispricing strayed from zero, but reliably returned to
the mean.
&nbsp;The extremes of those deviations represented trading
opportunities.
<h2>Limitations</h2>
This is only a preliminary study. &nbsp;A deeper study could
address
these issues, among others.<br>
<ul>
  <li>The study used closing
prices, which are dissynchronized between
the futures market (3:00 PM Eastern) and the stock market (4:00 PM
Eastern). &nbsp;The unmatched closing times inevitably introduce
unwelcome noise into the model.</li>
  <li>The recent large
variance in the residuals needs further
research. &nbsp;Will a simple re-fit of the model to recent data
eliminate the excess variance, including the fat tails in the Q-Q
diagram?</li>
  <li>This study used Perpetual
Data&reg; from <a href="http://www.csidata.com">Commodity Systems Inc.</a>
for futures
prices. &nbsp;This is convenient for a quick study, but should
probably
be replaced by roll-forward data in order to improve the model's
credibility. </li>
</ul>
